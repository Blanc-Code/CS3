				<h1>Magic Power Systems</h1>
				<p>Magic is based upon an energy harnessed called mana. It is a basic element for a mage, who weilds mana, to cast spells, which is made from mana. Spells what every mage could do and each there are a lot of different spells. The principal of magic is to control the Laws of the world such as time, space, gravity, sound, and reality. The ways spells are created are through different ways such as language magic such as Dragon Tongue, Elven Tongue, and Fairy Tongue while there is magic chanting and magical arthimetics with each Magic System having different pros and cons to different races.</p>
				<p>The Magic Power System basically is composed of the purity of mana, storage of mana, knowledge of spells, spell casting speed, and mana recovery. Generally stories just portray this simply through ranks from 1 to 9 which make it easier for both the writer and reader to keep track of. The purity of mana means spells can be more effective with less the amount while storage of mana is the limit of mana a mage can have. knowledge of spells are important for castings spells of course but spell casting speed is very essential especially in combat. Mana recovery is also important in lasting longer and getting back to peak performance fast.</p>

				<p>Mages haves different variants such as Combat Mages, who reinforce their bodies with magic, and Magic Knights, who reinforce their weapons with magic. There is also Alchemists, who use magic to make potions, and Magic Blacksmith, who use magic to make magic equipment. Mages can be further subdivided by the element they wield the most. Although mages could make any spell of any element, there are high disadvantages if the mage does not have an aptitude to that element. Generally, a mage could only be called a Dual Mage if he or she has high aptitude to 2 elements.</p>
				<p>The elements can be such as basic ones such as fire, water, earth, or air and some variants such as light, metal, dark, ice, poison, curse, illusion, or nature while there can be advanced elements like gravity, sound, space, time, and reality and some race specific variants such as spirit, gem, body, blood, and black magic</p>
