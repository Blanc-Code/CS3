				<h2>A theoretical world based in many popular and fictional ideas</h2>
				<p>Many stories have a similar format templates in fantasy. Some genres took in magic and dragons as a base while chinese took in cultivation and martial arts as a power system. Stories could be based in the future where there is colonialization on other planets. Others could be heroes and villains with superpowers and abilities.</p>
				<p>Settings can be based like in the medieval ages with kings and queens. The eastern setting would have emperors with buildings like pagodas and such. It could be futuristic like highly technological world with hovercars and electronic buildings. It could also be mysterious with suspicous things fogging the desolate land. A setting may even just be set in a modern world with some minor changes to fit in with a certain fantasy template.</p>
				<p>This website will explain these fantasy templates and settings. It will talk about magic, martial arts, abilities, and world structure. Power structure will be explained and so will races such as dragons, goblins, vampires, and elves.</p>
