				<h1>Ability Power Systems</h1>
				<p>Abilities is based upon a certain energy, most of the time it is either stamina or mental energy(mentality). Abilities are all different and they can pretty much to anything. They come in different forms such as quirks in My Hero Academia, and they may have certain limitations, weaknesses, and drawbacks, and the like. These abilities can pretty much be any idea that can be thought of in the head like physical, mental, spritual, and reality based abilities. These abilities may be genetic from races such as beastmen who can transform or elves whose physical capabilies are much suited for dexterity, flexibility, speed, and sense which correlate to an ability.</p>
				<p>The Ability Power System is hard to grasp as Abilities are too wide in terms of what they can do. Some abilities are helpful in combat but there are others which can even bestow revival and turn back time hence the discrepances. Generally authors just come up with their ranking from F to S rank with the judgment of their rank based on their potential. Depending on the story, abilites can or cannot be strengthened but a unique thing about them is how they can be used in clever ways due to Abilities being unique from one another.</p>

				<p>Espers abilities generally have different kinds such as Physical which apply to the body being Transformation, Physiology, Enhancement, and so on. Mental which applies to the mind being Telepathy, Mind Reading, Mind Control, Mind Wipe, Mental Computation, and so on. Spiritual applies to spirits, ghosts, and mysticism such as Soul Eyes, Soul Summon, Soul Damage, Soul Link, and so on.</p>
				<p>There is Control and Conjure which both have something to do with Controlling Reality or Conjuring something into reality such as Pyrokenises, Telekenises, Hydrokenises, Hemokenises, Atom Creation, Reality Bending, Gravity creation, and so on.</p>
