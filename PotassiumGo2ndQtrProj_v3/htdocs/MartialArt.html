				<h1>Martial Power Systems</h1>
				<p>Martial arts is based on an energy called Qi. It is a basic element for a Cultivator, who weilds Qi, to perform Martial Art Techniques, which is performed through Qi and Qi flows. Qi flow is a pattern of internal flowing Qi that corresponds to a certain effect to the body and can extend further to affect the world. The principal of martial arts is to comprehend the Dao of the world such as time, space, gravity, sound, and reality. There are different categories of Martial Art techniques such as Orthodox, Unorthodox, and those in between. Orthodox techniques build a strong foundation but are slower when compared to Unorthodox techniques of the same rank. Unorthodox are able to speed up cultivation to soar through cultivation stages speedily but it may give problems to their foundation making them weaker that those of that same cultivation stage as them.</p>
				<p>The Martial Power System basically is composed of the purity of Qi, storage of Qi, knowledge of techniques, technique performance speed, qi recovery, and qi nature. Generally stories just portray this through ranks or realsm such as Body Tempering Realm, Qi Gathering Realm, Qi Refining Realm, Qi Condensation Realm, Foundation Establishment Realm, Golden Core Realm, Nascent Realm, Earth Realm, Heavenly Realm, Dao Realm and so on. The purity of Qi means techniques can be more effective with less the amount while storage of Qi is the limit of Qi a Cultivator can have. knowledge of techniques are important for performing martial arts of course and technique performance speed is very essential especially in combat. Qi recovery is also important in lasting longer and getting back to peak performance fast.</p>
