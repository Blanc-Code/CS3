						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;color:red">The theme looks well. The plain white is able to make way for the important image to be in the spotlight. The blue color is able to make a cool color and calming like how a library would be making the color fit in to what the website is showcasing.</td>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Do the colors or theme work well together?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Due to my inexperience, all I can say is that it is at least well organized with everything grouped and labeled in a simple way in which a typical user can understand and use with ease. With this, I can infer that the elements are indeed "orchestrated properly".</td>

					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;color:red">The logo or brand of the site is indeed presented very well due to it having the color red and white as opposed to the blue surroundings which makes it stand out. The logo too is also small enough for the users to not be bothered by the logo and try what the site is showing but is also big enough for the user to glance at it and ingrain the information into their mind. Their logo is also simple which makes it easy to remember and pass on through conversation but I digress.</td>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Is the product/company branding visually presented?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;color:red">The color is minimal and plain but the simple color design still gives the user a feeling of organization and calmness. You see, people like organized and simple things and hectic design could be cool but they may also stress and take away the attention of users when they should focus on what they actually clicked on the site for, the site's products.</td>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Do the colors emulate the appropriate mood and feelings of the content?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">The colors seem to be plain and neutral giving it an open welcome to anyone of age, gender, and culture. This site after all doesn't focus on these things.</td>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Are the colors age, gender, or culture appropriate</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">It doesn't entirely follow the rule and uses plain 90% of the time but I think that plain strategy is effective due to the goal of the site is to showcase to the users the eye-catching products on display.</td>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Does the color palette used effectively follow the 60/30/10 rule?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;color:red">The webisite only used contrasting colors for the logo being red to make is memorable while also using black as the text to contrast the white background to let people read and process the information efficiently.</td>

text contents, using colors?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;color:red">The colors weren't used to seperate the sections but the site was organized and labeled in a way that makes it easy for a section to be distinguished between sections. Of course, color can be responsible for the bold labels that contrast the background making it easy to navigate the section and find what the users want.</td>
						<td style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black">Are the colors effectively used to separate certain sections or portions of the page?</td>

“wholeness”?</td>
