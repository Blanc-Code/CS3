				<li>Sung from the view of a Kappa, a rare youkai that can cross the Milky Way river. It is considered to be the third and final of the series despite Manbou saying that they could be watched in any order. This song sums up all events and viewpoints, and reveals the series' moral.</li>
				<li>In this song, the Kappa mentioned itself that even though it knew about the tale of the separated couple, all it wanted was a job, since it got rejected many times. Hearing about the idiotic company of Orihime, it came for an interview, and met her.</li>
				<li>Orihime soon requested it to bring Hikoboshi to her. The Kappa didn't want to do it, but it did for the job. It came to the other bank to find "a man with musculus muscles (who was Hikoboshi)," and was attacked by him</li>
				<li>The man stated that if he won a fight against a Kappa, he could cross the river. The Kappa, however, made him keel over and dragged him back to Orihime. It's now said that surely the couple didn't know that two river banks had different time flows.</li>
				<li>The scene changes to Tanabata and Hikoboshi went to the Milky Way. He repeats the same line as Orihime and admits that he ignored the pain of not meeting but the difference being that he distracted himself in training. Having cried, he sees a kappa flying over to him so he can finally... beat the kappa to show his might. Unfortunately for him, he was beaten mercilessly and easily. Even the kappa insulted Hikoboshi for his overwhelmingly weak strength against the kappa. He was bent in two, knocked out and carried away.</li>
				<li>When the Kappa returned, Orihime was aged, but Hikoboshi was still young. The Kappa felt bad for the couple ending up like that. However, before it could say anything, the two lovers were simply joyous and happy, something which brought tears to the Kappa's eyes. It wondered how, after being divided for so long and then having an awful reunion, they could be so joyous. Orihime and Hikoboshi replied "Because we love each other..." which is the moral of the series.</li>
