				</li>
				<li>Sung from the character Orihime's perspective, which corresponds with the star Vega. This song is considered to be the first of the series, despite Manbou saying they could be watched in any order. The song starts with the "prologue" of the series, and then continues on to Orihime's song.</li>
				<li>Orihime, sad that the "promised day" has never been clear, she searched for a loophole in the god's trick and finds that Kappa could cross the Milky Way. The only problem is they're an extremely rare youkai. One day, when she was walking on the outskirts of town, she found a crowd of youkai. She was surprised and a little put-off to find they were all crying. Their shoelaces were untied because their mothers always did it for them. "Feeling pity for the imbeciles," she taught them to tie their shoes. The amazed and overjoyed demons then decided that they'd follow her anywhere.</li>
				<li>Orihime ended up forming a "fearsome youkai dispatch company." The idiotic youkai were payed low wages "but given packs of gum, they worked with glee." The business blossomed and they even got along with politicians. Orihime ended up forgetting about the possibility of crossing the river and devoted herself to the important management of the company.</li>
				<li>Hearing the reputation of this idiotic company with youkai too stupid to figure out the process of meal tickets, a kappa decided to come in for an interview. Orihime has a strange feeling that she's been looking for a kappa when suddenly the PV shows a flashback of her meeting Hikoboshi when she was younger and how they ended up close before being separated.</li>
				<li>Finally, on the night of Tanabata, Orihime admits she ignored the pain of not meeting him, often pretending to just be deep in thought. She begs the kappa, with tears in her eyes, to bring Hikoboshi to her. The kappa agreed and flew over the river, where it suddenly started beating up Hikoboshi. Orihime is surprised and confused, stating that the youkai are all as dumb as each other; "So slow returning, but such a fast puncher!"</li>
				<li>The song ends with Hikoboshi looking "more mature than he'd been before," and a "to be continued" sign.</li>
