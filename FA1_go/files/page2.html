				</li>
				<li>Sung from the viewpoint of the character named Hikoboshi, corresponding with the star Altair. It is considered to be the second song of the series, despite Manbou stating they could be watched in any order. The song starts with the "prologue" of the series, and then continues to Hikoboshi's song.</li>
				<li>The song begins with Hikoboshi and an ox as he rants on how "this night's never been clear" and he's sure that, night after night, it'll always rain. The only ones known to be able to cross the river were a rare youkai called Kappa. Hikoboshi then ponders if it's something they possess. He comes to the conclusion that all he needs is their might and lung capacity.</li>
				<li>It then moves on to another him surround by pills (presumably steroids or something similar) as he lifts oxen by their horns. Hikoboshi admits 60% of his wages now go to his muscles. He then repeats the same line Orihime had in her song, "Isn't crossing the Milky Way just science fiction?" yet his obsession is with exercise rather than business.</li>
				<li>He went and trained on a mountain of oni and trained under the "god of massive pecs". Doing so he broke rocks and uplifted trees. Found a group of people in "strange fashion" going into a hut. Trying to investigate what wicked schemes the group of suspicous people are brewing, Hikoboshi blasted off the hut's roof with a punch. Unexpectedly, the group of people were just college students who were making computers. Enraged, Hikoboshi broke their computers and they ran with the former saying "There's seven of you in all! Do something you can all do together!". At that moment Hikoboshi tried to remember what with the familiar number 7 saying, "Did something happen on July 7th?"</li>
				<li>The scene changes to Tanabata and Hikoboshi went to the Milky Way. He repeats the same line as Orihime and admits that he ignored the pain of not meeting but the difference being that he distracted himself in training. Having cried, he sees a kappa flying over to him so he can finally... beat the kappa to show his might. Unfortunately for him, he was beaten mercilessly and easily. Even the kappa insulted Hikoboshi for his overwhelmingly weak strength against the kappa. He was bent in two, knocked out and carried away.</li>
				<li>The song ends with Orihime being "An older woman" and a "to be continued" sign.</li>
